# Sorting-Algorithm-API-Visualizer
Spring Boot API that provides a quick way to sort data using different algorithms. The purpose of this project is to provide insight into different metrics from different algorithms to help the end user identify which algorithm would be best suited for their particular use case. Visualization is also possible through UI built with Thyme Leaf.
